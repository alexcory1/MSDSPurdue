# GRAD 50500
This is my repository for GRAD50500: Foundations in Data Science. This 8-week course serves as the first course in the DS sequence introducing programming in optionally Python or R, as well as an overview of the most important topics in Data Science such as Statistics, Distributions, Regression, and an exploration of data science tools. This course will contain a final project we will spend 6 weeks working on. 

The textbook for this course is Montgomery, D. C. (2020). Introduction to statistical quality control. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
