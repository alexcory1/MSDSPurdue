# Final Project Proposal

## Dataset

I will be using data from Class 8 heavy duty vehicles, weighing at least 33,001 pounds.

### Structure
The data is contained in two .xslx tables. Table one is organized into identifiers, condition indicators (soot, viscosity, acidity, base), chemical degredation indicators (oxidation and nitration), and wear metals (iron, lead, copper, chromium, aluminum), and contaminants (silicon, sodium, potassium).
Table two gives the fuel efficiency for each fleet.

### Metadata
Observations in fleet data: 111
Observations in efficiency data: 24

## Research Questions
    - Does an increase in degredation indicators  (oxidation/nitration) effect engine wear metals?
    - Does soot increasing correspond to more engine wear metals
    - Do wear metals increase linearly or non-linearly
